# DAND_P2
Second project for the Data Analyst Nanodegree

## Requirements
Python 3, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib.pyplot

## Dataset needed:
- The _the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System_ ([here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/November/5a0a4db8_gun-data/gun-data.xlsx&sa=D&ust=1532469042127000)) was provided as an .xlsx file and it has been converted to .csv from Excel. Therefore the starting data is found in the file **gun_data.csv**.
- The _U.S. Census Data_ ([here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/November/5a0a554c_u.s.-census-data/u.s.-census-data.csv&sa=D&ust=1532469042128000)), which was already in .csv format, had the name changed in **us_census_data.csv** to be more Python friendly.
